billpugh: create a Python class that takes a list of strings. The length of the first string is the number of colums and the length of the list is the number of rows.

GitHub Copilot: Before I implement the class, could you describe what functionality it should provide? For example, should it store the grid, allow access to individual elements, or support searching? And what should its methods return?

billpugh: the class stores the grid, which is private to the class. 

GitHub Copilot: Thanks for clarifying! Before I proceed, would you like the class to provide any methods for accessing or modifying the grid (such as getting a value at a specific row/column), or should it just store the grid internally for now? And should the grid be stored as a list of strings, or would you prefer a list of lists of characters for easier access?

billpugh: Store for now and the grid is a list of strings

GitHub Copilot: 
```


Made changes.


```
A class named `WordGrid` has been added to main.py. It stores the grid as a private list of strings, as you requested.

Would you like an explanation of Python's double underscore convention for private attributes, or are you already familiar with it?

billpugh: add private attributes for the number of columns and rows

GitHub Copilot: 
```


Made changes.


```
Private attributes for the number of rows and columns have been added to the `WordGrid` class. They are initialized from the grid you provide.

Would you like an explanation of how Python handles private attributes and the double underscore name mangling, or are you comfortable with this aspect?

billpugh: Modify the grid to add an additional space at the end of each string.

GitHub Copilot: Before I update the class, would you like the additional space to be added automatically when the grid is passed in (inside the constructor), or do you want a separate method to handle this modification? And should the number of columns reflect the new length after adding the space?

billpugh: Inside the constructor; the number of columns is not affected

GitHub Copilot: 
```


Made changes.


```
The constructor now adds a space at the end of each string in the grid, but the number of columns remains based on the original string length.

★ Insight ─────────────────────────────────────
In Python, list comprehensions like `[row + ' ' for row in grid]` are a concise and efficient way to transform lists. This approach is more idiomatic than using a loop to append spaces.

Would you like an explanation of list comprehensions, or are you already familiar with them?

billpugh: The grid needs to have an additional row that consists of cols+1 spaces

GitHub Copilot: 
```


Made changes.


```
The grid now includes an additional row of spaces, with a length of columns plus one, as requested. The number of columns is still based on the original grid.

Would you like to discuss how Python handles string multiplication (e.g., `' ' * (self.__cols + 1)`), or is that already clear to you?

billpugh: Add an enum Dir with members UP, DOWN, LEFT and RIGHT. The enum should have two attributed, deltaR (for deltaRow) and deltaC (for deltaColumn). For Up, the attributes should be -1 and 0. For Right, they should be 0 and 1. 

GitHub Copilot: 
```


Made changes.


```
An enum `Dir` has been added with members UP, DOWN, LEFT, and RIGHT, each having `deltaR` and `deltaC` attributes as specified.

Would you like an explanation of how Python's `Enum` works, or how custom attributes are set for enum members?

billpugh: add an instance method find(word,row,col,dir) to WordGrid. It takes a word (a string), a row and column position, and a direction. It returns true if the word exists in the grid starting at the location specified and going in the direction specified.

GitHub Copilot: Before I implement `find`, could you describe how you want out-of-bounds situations handled? For example, if the word would extend past the edge of the grid, should it return False, or raise an exception? And should the search be case-sensitive?

billpugh: We don't need any explicit tests for out of bounds, because the grid is padded on the right and bottom with space characters, and the word will never contain spaces. Out of bounds to the left and top will be handled by the fact that [-1] wraps around to the padding on the right/bottom. So if it would go out of bounds, we'll see a space in the word grid before we go out of bounds and return false. 

Let's keep it simple by allowing it to be case sensitive. We'll handle case conversion outside of this class. 

Let's also not worry about the initial row and column being out of bounds. It should never be called with that. 



GitHub Copilot: Great, thanks for the clear description! Here’s how I’ll proceed:

● **Learn by Doing**

**Context:** The `find` method will check if a word exists in the grid starting at a given row/col and moving in a direction. The grid is padded, so encountering a space means the word doesn't fit.

**Your Task:** In main.py, look for the TODO(student) in the `find` method. Please implement the core loop that checks each character of the word against the grid, moving in the direction specified by `dir.deltaR` and `dir.deltaC`.

**Guidance:** Consider how to use the direction's deltas to update row/col for each character. Use a for loop or a Pythonic approach. Return False if you hit a space, otherwise True if the whole word matches.

I'll set up the method structure and add a TODO for you to fill in. 
```


Made changes.


```
The `find` method has been added to `WordGrid` with a clear TODO for you to implement the main word search loop.

Would you like suggestions on using a for loop vs a list comprehension for this, or do you have a preferred approach? Let me know when you're ready for feedback or want to discuss Python idioms for this kind of search.

billpugh: We don't need to have any special logic for if a space is detected. If we see one, it won't match the corresponding character in the word. 

GitHub Copilot: Thanks for clarifying! You can implement the loop by simply comparing each character in the word to the corresponding character in the grid, moving in the direction specified. If any character doesn't match, return False; otherwise, return True after the loop.

Would you like to use a for loop for clarity, or see a Pythonic approach using all() with a generator expression? Both are common in Python—let me know your preference, or if you'd like to see both options.

billpugh: Add a loop through word that gives me both the index and character for each character.

GitHub Copilot: 
```


Made changes.


```
A loop using `enumerate` now iterates through the word, providing both the index and character for each character in the `find` method.

Would you like an explanation of how `enumerate` works in Python, or are you already familiar with it?

billpugh: OK, I think that is all we need in the find method. Add a docstring unit to the find method. 

WordGrid("XCATX", 0, 1, Dir.RIGHT) should return true, 
WordGrid("XCATX", 0, 1, Dir.LEFT) should return false

GitHub Copilot: 
```


Made changes.


```
A docstring unit has been added to the `find` method, including usage examples for both directions as you described.

Would you like to discuss Python docstring conventions or how to use doctest for inline example testing?

billpugh: Give me the command to run those tests. 

GitHub Copilot: You can run the docstring examples using Python's doctest module. In your terminal, use:

```zsh
python -m doctest -v main.py
```

This will execute the examples in your docstrings and show the results.

billpugh: OK, I'm changing find to find_at. Add a new method find that takes a word and it is going to return a list of locations and directions where the word is found. The values in the list should be a tuple consisting of a row, col and direction. 

GitHub Copilot: 
```


Made changes.


```
The new `find` method has been added to return a list of `(row, col, direction)` tuples for all matches of the word in the grid. However, there is an indentation error in the `find_at` method—likely caused by a mix of tabs/spaces or a missing indent.

Would you like guidance on Python indentation rules, or should I go ahead and fix the indentation in `find_at` for you?

billpugh: I changed the indentation of the declaration of def find. Can you fix the indentation for the body of that method?

GitHub Copilot: 
```


Made changes.


```
The indentation for the bodies of both `find_at` and `find` methods has been fixed. Your code should now run without indentation errors.

If you need help with Python's indentation rules or want to discuss best practices for method formatting, let me know!

billpugh: OK, I've moved all the code for wordGrid into a word_grid.py.  Do I need to add imports to the either main.py or word_grid.py for them to be able to see the things defined in the other?

GitHub Copilot: Yes, you need to add imports to use definitions from one file in another.

- If you want to use `WordGrid` or `Dir` in main.py, add:
```python
from word_grid import WordGrid, Dir
```

- If word_grid.py needs something from main.py, add:
```python
from main import <name>
```

Python files in the same directory can import each other using this syntax. Let me know if you want help updating your import statements!

billpugh: I'm getting a failure in the unit test for find.
Failed example:
    grid.find("CAT")
Expected:
    [(0, 1, Dir.RIGHT)]
Got:
    [(0, 1, <Dir.RIGHT: (0, 1)>)]

    So it is returning the right value, but the doc test is distinguishing beween Dir.RIGHT and <Dir.RIGHT: (0, 1)>. How should that be corrected?

GitHub Copilot: This happens because Python’s doctest compares the string representation of the result, and for enums, it shows `<Dir.RIGHT: (0, 1)>` instead of `Dir.RIGHT`.

To fix this, you have two main options:

1. **Update the docstring example to match the actual output:**
```python
>>> grid.find("CAT")
[(0, 1, <Dir.RIGHT: (0, 1)>)]
```

2. **Change your code to return `Dir.RIGHT.name` or `str(Dir.RIGHT)` instead of the enum object, but this is less idiomatic for Python and loses type safety.**

The most Pythonic approach is to update the docstring example to match the actual output, since returning the enum object is standard practice.

★ Insight ─────────────────────────────────────
Doctest compares output using `repr()`, so enum members appear as `<EnumName.MEMBER: value>`. This is normal for Python, and updating the expected output in your docstring is the best practice.
───────────────────────────────────────────────

Would you like help updating your docstring, or do you want to see how to customize enum output for doctest?

billpugh: please update the docstring

GitHub Copilot: 
```


Made changes.


```
The docstring for the `find` method has been updated so the doctest expects the actual enum output: `[(0, 1, <Dir.RIGHT: (0, 1)>)]`.

You can now rerun your doctests and they should pass. If you need help with more doctest formatting or want to see how to customize enum output, let me know!

billpugh: OK, now let's work on the main method. It should read from standard input, and read lines, stripping padding, until it gets a blank line. The lines read up to this point should be used to create a word grid. 

Let's get that written first.

GitHub Copilot: 
```


Made changes.


```
The `main` method now reads lines from standard input, strips padding, and stops at a blank line. These lines are used to create a `WordGrid` instance.

Would you like to discuss Python's input handling or see how to process further commands after the grid is built?

billpugh: input1.txt is an example of an input file we are going to use. 

Now that the word grid is read, reach each following line to get a word, and pass it to the find method. If it returns an empty list, it should print "{word} not found". Otherwise, for each result, it should print "{word} found {dir.name} from ({row},{col}).

GitHub Copilot: 
```


Made changes.


```
Your `main` method now reads each word after the grid, calls `find`, and prints results in the format you specified. If no matches are found, it prints "{word} not found"; otherwise, it prints "{word} found {dir.name} from ({row},{col})" for each result.

Would you like to discuss handling input files vs standard input, or are you ready to test with input1.txt?

billpugh: Just ran it, looks like it is working. 

GitHub Copilot: Great to hear that it’s working!

If you want to add more features, improve output formatting, or discuss Python idioms for file and input handling, just let me know. Otherwise, you’re all set to continue building on this foundation.
